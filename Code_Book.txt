Dataset downloaded from: ![here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Included files:
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

Getting and Cleaning Data:
1. feactures.txt
Description: The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
id: id feactures
name.feacture: name feactures

> nrow(features)
[1] 561

2. Training set: X_train.txt
description:
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
> ncol(train)
[1] 561

* Column names were added from features
colnames(train) <- features$name.feature

3. Test set: X_test.txt
description:
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
> ncol(test)
[1] 561
